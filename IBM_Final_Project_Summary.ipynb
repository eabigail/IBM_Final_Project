The data was cleaned, disregarding any null values or neighbourhoods and boroughs that were \"not assigned\"; focusing only on the information that was relevant to the city of Calgary. Boroughs that were outside of Calgary were also removed to prevent redundancy.\n\n##### Foursquare\nFoursquare was then used to explore the neighbourhoods of Calgary and find the top 100 venues located within a 1500m (1.5km) radius from each neighbourhood. The number of each unique venue was counted and identified per neighbourhood, tabulated and charted. \n\nThe following headers were used:\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Neighbourhood</th>\n      <th>1st Most Common Venue</th>\n      <th>2nd Most Common Venue</th>\n      <th>3rd Most Common Venue</th>\n      <th>4th Most Common Venue</th>\n      <th>5th Most Common Venue</th>  \n      <th>6th Most Common Venue</th>  \n      <th>7th Most Common Venue</th>  \n      <th>8th Most Common Venue</th>  \n      <th>9th Most Common Venue</th>\n      <th>10th Most Common Venue</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n</table>\n\n\n##### k-means Clusters\n\nThe Elbow Method was used to determine the best \"k\" value before proceeding with k-means clustering.

When grouping them by the most common venues, yoga studio was rarely in the Top 3 Most Common Venues for the neighbourhoods in each cluster.\n\nIn Cluster 0, Yoga Studios appeared five times. Out of the five times, the highest recorded was as the 3rd Most Common Venue.\n\nIn Cluster 3, it was the 5th most common venue for one of the neighbourhoods, the 2nd most common venue for the only neighbourhood in Cluster 4 and the 3rd most common venue for one of two neighbourhoods with a \"Yoga Studio\" in Cluster 5.\n\nOut of all the clusters, it was the 2nd most common venue in Cluster 4, in the neighbourhood of Brentwood, Collingwood, Nose Hill.\n\nFrom this information, a few things can be noted based of the criteria the client provided.\n\n   * Density\n   * Proximity to Downtown Core\n   * Risk Factor\n\nWith respect to Density, existing Yoga Studios are not as abundant when compared to the food and dining restaurants in Calgary. Furthermore, they are also distanced enough from each other, as they are scattered across multiple clusters. There are advantages and disadvantages to opening a studio in locations where there are no other yoga studios around the vicinity.\n\nAn advantage could be that there is less competition around the general area. Another could be that opening a yoga studio in a different neighbourhood, far from the ones with existing studios could access a group of customers that may have avoided the other studios due to its distance. The accessibility it would create for people wishing to attend a yoga studio located closer to their homes would be appealing to new customers.\n\nHowever, a disadvantage of opening a yoga studio where there are not a lot of other studios nearby could be a lack of visibility. As most people are creatures of habit, it can be assumed that most people typically stick to travelling and visiting the same area(s) in their day to day lives. This could prove challenging in terms of visibility, as less yoga studio users may be passing by the new studio. This of course, could be mitigated with differnt marketing strategies, but it is something to consider.\n\nSince the existing studios are scattered throughout Calgary, their proximity to downtown Calgary is varied. Selecting a place closer or in downtown could make it accessible to users who work downtown who wish to attend the studio before or after work, minimizing extra commute in their part. However, it can be assumed that the closer the building is to downtown, the higher the cost would be to rent or own a lot.\n\nThat being said, selecting a location situated far from downtown and going into the suburbs could have its perks and setbacks as well. It opens the opportunity for family or group yoga classes, should the client wish. It could promote a more \"relaxing\" or \"calming\" outside environment for users who are entering or leaving the studio. However, choosing a location far into the suburbs (for example, in the deep south such as the neighbourhood in Cluster 1), could defer those wishing to attend the studio who live far in the North.\n\nDue to the lack of competition, it can be argued that the biggest concern and risk associated would be the chosen location and its associated cost.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Conclusion"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Should the client be willing to take large risks in expanding their business, then expanding their business close to downtown core, would be their best approach.
